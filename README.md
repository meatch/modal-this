# ModalThis

A NPM package for ADA Compliant Modals.

> :warning: **Please Note:** Almost there, not currently ready for public consumption.

## API Docs

## Goals
Create a Aria Compliant Modal that will play nicely with VoiceOver. VoiceOver currently has its own set of issues/bugs that are next to impossible to overcome; this library, therefore, aims to degrade gracefully, and wherever possible correct these issues.

### My Teammates
This was battle tested in our web applications by several ba's, devs, and qa. Without my team, I would not be where I am today, and neither would this package.
